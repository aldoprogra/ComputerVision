## TO DO

Basics on how process images and how process them for dealing with noises.

<ol>
  <li>Add Gaussian (standard deviation=20) and salt & pepper(density=20%) noise to the provided images:o display the images, the noisy images, and their histograms.  </li>
  <li>Remove the noise by using a moving average, a low-pass Gaussian filter and a median filter: o use two different spatial supports: 3x3 pixels and 7x7 pixel and display the filters by using imagesc() and surf()and display the resulting images.  </li>
  <li>Implement linear filters and display result, use filters with a spatial support of 7x7 pixels.  </li>
  <li>Apply the Fourier Transform (FFT) on the provided images:
o display the magnitude (log) of the transformed images;
o display the magnitude of the transformed low-pass Gaussian filter (spatial support of 101x101 pixels with sigma=5).  </li>
<li>Apply the Fourier Transform (FFT) on the provided images:
o display the magnitude (log) of the transformed images;
o display the magnitude of the transformed low-pass Gaussian filter (spatial support of 101x101 pixels with sigma=5).  </li>
